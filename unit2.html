        <h3><b>2.1.1</b> Describing the content and layout for each page.</h3>

        <h3><b>2.1.5</b> Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites</h3>

        <div class="text">
            <p>Of course, websites aren’t able to do anything that they would like to do, as there are various constraints that they are uder. One of the biggest constraints is to do with copyright, since many things that a website might want to use - such as images, videos, music, and even someone else’s code - are usually are copyright protected. Websites need to be careful in making sure that nothing they use is copyright protected, and if it is they have permission to do so. Other constraints on a website might include the aspect ratio of any user’s screen, whether it is mobile friendly, and how zooming in and out affects elements of the website (such as the quality of photos).[7]</p><br><br>

        <h3><b>2.1.6</b> Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them</h3>

        <div class="text">
            <p>When it comes to people with disabilities, it is important that a website should be accessible to anyone’s particular needs. For example, colourblind people might have difficulty navigating a website if it relies to heavily on coliurs that they cannot see, thus the design should ideally use colours that they can distinguish, or alternatively have a option that colourblind people could activate to make it easier for them. These methods can be extrapolated to help with all kinds of disabilities, such as reading disabilties, auditor disabilities, cognative disabilities, physical disabilities, and speech disabilities. Obviously, it will be very difficult to create a website that no one will have any problems with, so the design should be flexible enough to allow any necessary changes that my crop up.[8]</p><br><br>

        <h3><b>2.1.7</b> Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites</h3>

        <div class="text">
            <p>Using the correct file types in a website, such as for images and videos, as an often overlooked issue that websites have to deal with. For example, using the wrong file type for an image can affect the way they appear on the website, and even whether the user can even see the image. In this case, it is important to make sure that the best possible file type is being used. Obviously there is no one single file type that all websites should use, but for images the best options tend to be JPEGs, PNGs and GIFs, and for videos MP4s.[9]</p><br><br>
