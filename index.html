    <div class="text">
        <p>My name is George Tilley, and as of writing I am 22 years old. I have two parents and two siblings, as well as a large extended family spread out all over the place. I am originally from the glorious seaside resort of Brighton in the south. Growing up I loved Brighton, with its beach, culture and seagulls.<br> 
        After finishing school in 2015, I decided to go to the University of Sheffield to study mathematics. Since my brother already lived in Manchester, I agreed to move in with him, and every weekday would commute to Sheffield. I graduated in 2019. <br> I don't really like showing pictures of myself online, so I have provided below an incredibly highly detailed sketch of myself to compensate. <br><br><br> <img id="sketch" src="sketch1.jpg" alt="Rough Sketch"></p><br><br>

    <h3>Strengths</h3>
    <div class="text">
        <p>In my life, I have achieved the following:
        <ul>
            <li>I speak ten languages;
            <li>I once wrestled a lion into submission;
            <li>I can crush a brick in my bare hands;
            <li>I have discovered the true meaning of life.
        </ul>
        I also have some real accomplishments/skills: 
        <ul>
            <li>I can juggle;
            <li>I can draw reasonable well;
            <li>I can solve complex mathematical problems;
            <li>I play two different musical instruments (not at the same time);
            <li>I did a GCSE in German, so if you speak to me in German I might pick up about a quarter of what you are saying;
            <li>I like playing games in my spare time;
            <li>I am an excellent singer, but only when no one is around;
            <li>I know a lot about history, so if you want I could bore you endlessly with pointless trivia.
        </ul></p>
    </div>

    <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
    <div class="text">
        <p>I do, however, have some weaknesses:
        <ul>
            <li>Dust;
            <li>Bees and wasps;
            <li>Large social gatherings;
            <li>Sport;
            <li>The inevitabe futality of our own existence.
        </ul>
        If you are planning to kill me, please forget this.</p><br><br>

    <h3>My Interest in Coding</h3>

    <div class="text">
        <p>While in my first year at Univeristy, I was given the option to take a module about mathematical investigation skills. Since all the alternatives sounded awful, I decided to go for it. This proved to be a great decision, as the module involved a basic introduction to coding, which I almost instantly came to like. <br> The coding that I learnt was heavily maths-based, and was always meant to be a tool to aid in my studies, e.g. if I was studying a probability distribution and wanted to find a certain value of a probability density function, instead of doing the horrible calculations by hand, I would open up my computer and type out the few lines of code in order to get the answer. <br> After finishing my degree, I was left with a desire to continue expanding my knowledge of coding. I guess I like both front-end and back-end development, but if you put a gun to my head I would likely choose back-end.</p><br><br>

    <h2>Contacts</h2>
    <div class="text">
        <p>If you have a burning desire to contact me, email me and I'll probably reply.</p>
        <p id="email">georgetilley1@hotmail.co.uk</p>
        <p>If you have any strong opinions that you'd like to share with me - whether it is political, religious, or some special offer that I must absolutely buy right now - please feel free to keep them to yourself.<br> If you want to look me up on social media, don't bother. I'm not on there.</p><br><br><br><br>
