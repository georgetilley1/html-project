        <h2>Outcome 1</h2>

        <h3><b>1.1.1</b> Describing the purpose of IT in modern business </h3>

        <div class="text">
            <p>In modern business, IT plays a very important role. It helps to drive innovation, and innovation is the way for businesses to make profits faster than ever. IT gives businesses the tools to solve complex problems, helps them make better decisions, improves marketing, improves customer support, and improves resource management. Put simply, IT is to business what steam was to the industrial revolution.[1]</p><br><br>

        <h3><b>1.1.2</b> Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully – what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills? </h3>

        <div class="text">
            <p>The key to a successful digital project is the ability to utilise the right methods, skills, and tools. Obviously, there are numerous options available for businesses and the like to make use of, for example they could use kanban (improving speed and quality of delivery by increasing visibility of work in progress and limiting multi-tasking), agile (collaborating to iteratively deliver whatever works), scrum (enable a small, cross-functional self-managing team to delivery fast) etc.[2] <br> The kind of tools that a digital project might require depends on the project, and the methods selected for it. For example, if kanban methodology is being used, then trello could be a key tool to utilise this. Some common staples include Microsoft Office, might also be appropriate.
            On a separate note, the key skills required for a successful project depend entirely on the relevant role - the skills that a project manager needs might be quite different than that of a team member. However, some common skills include problem-solving, a degree of social media knowledge, attention to detail, good communication, and relationship building, among others.[3]</p><br><br>

        <h3><b>1.1.3</b> Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to your Trello board.</h3>

        <div class="text">
            <p>When it comes to planning a website, the first step should be deciding on a general plan, and utilising a relevant methodology to carry out said plan, for example utilising kanban planning in trello. Firstly, the overall structure of the website should be decided on, i.e. what pages will the website have, and how to navigate between them. When that is done, the next logical step will be to start filling the pages with information/content relevant to website’s purpose, so if a website is supposed to inform the reader about types of tree, we begin inputting information about trees. At the end, the style of the website should be decided on, and anything visually interesting that is deemed relevant (animations, easter eggs, pictures of trees, etc.) should be included. As the website comes together, the Trello will help to keep track of what tasks have been done, what is being done, and what has to be done.<br><a href="https://trello.com/b/I5Tvpwcs/website" target="blank">Link to Trello</a></p><br><br>

        <h3><b>1.1.4</b> Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why?</h3>

        <div class="text">
            <p>When a digital project is in the works, there a multitude of risks that could potentially occur to scupper things. Risks that could occur include:
            <ul>
                <li>Ineffective or low impact change management;
                <li>Artistice direction being muddled by too many committee decisions;
                <li> Differeing departmental requirements;
                <li>Reallocated resources;
                <li>Personal capacity;
                <li>Unavailable inputs when required;
                <li>Lack of personnel and resources;
                <li>Data issues;
                <li>Finding new workflows and methods problematic.
            </ul>
            This is by no means an exhaustive list, but are some of the most common problems that can arise when carrying out a digital project.[4]</p><br><br>

        <h3><b>1.1.5</b> Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?</h3>

        <div class="text">
            <p>When it comes to choosing the right software for a project, it’s important to grasp first why you need a certain software, and with this in mind set about creating a list of software requirements that your project will need, such as what you need the software to do, ease-of-use, technological preferences (e.g. Windows or Mac? Cloud or On-Base?), budgetary requirements, method of getting reports back, the scalability of the software, and any requirements that any potential vendor/client will have. Once this is complete, begn searching for a software package that will do what you want to do, and will fulfill the requirement syou have set.[5]</p><br><br>
        </div>

        <h3><b>1.1.6</b> Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. – How has Trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control?</h3>
    
        <div class="text">
            <p>When it comes to technologies used in building a website, Trello is very helpful in managing various tasks in the kanban method, and its simple and intuitive design means that it is very easy to use. Similarly, GitHub is very useful when working collaboratively by helping developers to share there code, manage projects, manage packages, and securing software, among many more features. GitHub has so many uses, that it is virtually guaranteed to meet the requirements or needs that any developer my have. Best of all, both Trello and GitHub are (at least mostly) free to use.</p><br><br>

        <h3><b>1.1.7</b> Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects?</h3>

        <div class="text">
            <p>In a nutshell, the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) is a worldwide privacy law regarding personal data - such as banking information and IP addresses - that affects the way that businesses can collect, store and use this data. Businesses that are to be found in direct breach of the GDPR are slapped with big fines, thus any digital project must comply by mapping their data, determining what data they need to keep, ensuring that security measures are put in place to prevent or contain any data breaches that might occur, making sure that acquiring and processing personal data only happens with and individual’s explicit consent, and stablishijng procedures for the handling of personal data.[6]</p><br><br>
