        <h2>Outcome 1</h2>

        <h3><b>1.1.1</b> Describing the purpose of IT in modern business </h3>

        <div class="text">
            <p>In modern business, IT plays a very important role. It helps to drive innovation, and innovation is the way for businesses to make profits faster than ever. IT gives businesses the tools to solve complex problems, helps them make better decisions, improves marketing, improves customer support, and improves resource management. Put simply, IT is to business what steam was to the industrial revolution. <up class="green">[1]</up></p><br><br>
        </div>

        <h3><b>1.1.2</b> Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully – what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills? </h3>

        <div class="text">
            <p>The key to a successful digital project is the ability to utilise the right methods, skills, and tools. Obviously, there are numerous options available for businesses and the like to make use of, for example they could use kanban (improving speed and quality of delivery by increasing visibility of work in progress and limiting multi-tasking), agile (collaborating to iteratively deliver whatever works), scrum (enable a small, cross-functional self-managing team to delivery fast) etc. <up class="green">[2]</up> <br> The kind of tools that a digital project might require depends on the project, and the methods selected for it. For example, if kanban methodology is being used, then trello could be a key tool to utilise this. Some common staples include Microsoft Office, might also be appropriate.
            On a separate note, the key skills required for a successful project depend entirely on the relevant role - the skills that a project manager needs might be quite different than that of a team member. However, some common skills include problem-solving, a degree of social media knowledge, attention to detail, good communication, and relationship building, among others. <up class="green">[3]</up></p><br><br>
        </div>

        <h3><b>1.1.3</b> Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to your Trello board.</h3>

        <div class="text">
            <p>When it comes to planning a website, the first step should be deciding on a general plan, and utilising a relevant methodology to carry out said plan, for example utilising kanban planning in trello. Firstly, the overall structure of the website should be decided on, i.e. what pages will the website have, and how to navigate between them. When that is done, the next logical step will be to start filling the pages with information/content relevant to website’s purpose, so if a website is supposed to inform the reader about types of tree, we begin inputting information about trees. At the end, the style of the website should be decided on, and anything visually interesting that is deemed relevant (animations, easter eggs, pictures of trees, etc.) should be included. As the website comes together, the Trello will help to keep track of what tasks have been done, what is being done, and what has to be done.<br><a href="https://trello.com/b/I5Tvpwcs/website" target="blank">Link to Trello</a></p><br><br>
        </div>

        <h3><b>1.1.4</b> Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why?</h3>

        <div class="text">
            <p>When a digital project is in the works, there a multitude of risks that could potentially occur to scupper things. Risks that could occur include:
            <ul>
                <li>Ineffective or low impact change management;
                <li>Artistice direction being muddled by too many committee decisions;
                <li> Differeing departmental requirements;
                <li>Reallocated resources;
                <li>Personal capacity;
                <li>Unavailable inputs when required;
                <li>Lack of personnel and resources;
                <li>Data issues;
                <li>Finding new workflows and methods problematic.
            </ul>
            This is by no means an exhaustive list, but are some of the most common problems that can arise when carrying out a digital project. <up class="green">[4]</up></p><br><br>
        </div>

        <h3><b>1.1.5</b> Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?</h3>

        <div class="text">
            <p>When it comes to choosing the right software for a project, it’s important to grasp first why you need a certain software, and with this in mind set about creating a list of software requirements that your project will need, such as what you need the software to do, ease-of-use, technological preferences (e.g. Windows or Mac? Cloud or On-Base?), budgetary requirements, method of getting reports back, the scalability of the software, and any requirements that any potential vendor/client will have. Once this is complete, begn searching for a software package that will do what you want to do, and will fulfill the requirement syou have set. <up class="green">[5]</up></p><br><br>
        </div>

        <h3><b>1.1.6</b> Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. – How has Trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control?</h3>
    
        <div class="text">
            <p>When it comes to technologies used in building a website, Trello is very helpful in managing various tasks in the kanban method, and its simple and intuitive design means that it is very easy to use. Similarly, GitHub is very useful when working collaboratively by helping developers to share there code, manage projects, manage packages, and securing software, among many more features. GitHub has so many uses, that it is virtually guaranteed to meet the requirements or needs that any developer my have. Best of all, both Trello and GitHub are (at least mostly) free to use.</p><br><br>
        </div>

        <h3><b>1.1.7</b> Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects?</h3>

        <div class="text">
            <p>In a nutshell, the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) is a worldwide privacy law regarding personal data - such as banking information and IP addresses - that affects the way that businesses can collect, store and use this data. Businesses that are to be found in direct breach of the GDPR are slapped with big fines, thus any digital project must comply by mapping their data, determining what data they need to keep, ensuring that security measures are put in place to prevent or contain any data breaches that might occur, making sure that acquiring and processing personal data only happens with and individual’s explicit consent, and stablishijng procedures for the handling of personal data. <up class="green">[6]</up></p><br><br>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Outcome 2</h2>

        <h3><b>1.2.1</b> Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello.</h3>

        <div class="text">
            <p>When it comes to the development of my website, I am very happy with the tools that I used in the planning and coding of my project - namely Slack, Trello, and Visual Studio Code - since they didn't have any bugs, and they did want I wanted of them.<br>
            I did however had trouble working with GitHub when publishing my website, in that I roughly figured out the key elements of  how to use it to make a live website, and yet still was unsure of how to properly navigate and use it. I also found it annoying when trying to set up my repository, since it took an annoying long time to go live. I imagine that if I had more time to get used to GitHub, and learn how it all works, then I would've had a better time using it.</p><br><br>
        </div>

        <h3><b>1.2.2</b> Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello.</h3>

        <div class="text">
            <p>Personally I think that Visual Studio Code was definitely an appropriate tool to use for this project, since I had no problems in using it, it wasn't as headache-inducing as using Notepad, and I think it would be very useful when working on any future projects. In particularly I liked how, even though I might use different coding languages, I can still rely on the same software.
            When it comes to Trello and Slack, I think that they definitely served a useful and important role, and were likely appropriate for the project, although I will accept that not using them wouldn't have dramatically changed the final result, and that their main benefit came from planning and communication, for which there are many other potential alternatives.</p><br><br>
        </div>

        <h3><b>1.2.3</b> Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?</h3>

        <div class="text">
            <p>Overall, I am definitely happy with the final outcome of the project. Looking at the website, I'm personally pleased with the layout and styling, although this is certainly a subjective view, and someone else might dislike it. I was concerned during the development of the website whether the styles were compatible, for example if the text clashed with the background. I feel that the website could have used some more content or pages, such as a contacts page, or better ways to link all the outcomes and subsections together.</p><br><br>
        </div>

        <h3><b>1.2.4</b> Describe further improvements you can make to your project.</h3>

        <div class="text">
            <p>When it comes to things that I think would have gone better, It took surprisingly long to create and input the word art, and so if I had just settled for some regular headings, it would have more time to work on other things I would have liked to implement. I would have hoped to have researched how to implement animations to further spice up the website, as well as hide some fun easter eggs across the websites. I also had the cool idea of making the text scroll like the Star Wars opening, but sadly from my research it looked quite complicated, and it probably would have made it harder to read, so I decided to spend on my time on more important tasks.</p><br><br>
        </div>

        <h3><b>1.2.5</b> Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose.</h3>

        <div class="text">
            <p>Flicking through the pages on my website, it appears to me that it matches the requirements set out at the beginning of the project, since it is organised and laid out in an easy to read manner, the pages are all linked together and are easily navigated between using the navigation bar, file formats all work within the website (or at least I haven't had any problems on my computer), and from testing and reading through the pages, they appear to have no bugs, errors, or spelling/syntax mistakes.</p><br><br>
        </div>
    </div>


    <div class="section">
        <h2>Outcome 3</h2>

        <h3><b>1.3.1</b> Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?</h3>

        <div class="text">
            <p>When it comes to the usage of IT tools and systems in terms of productivity and efficiency, there are multiple benefits, such as making collaboration easier, increasing communication, simplifies progress tracking, makes data and work more secure, and makes working remote much easier. Conversely, there are some drawbacks to these tools, such as that they can be quite distracting, they minimise interpersonal skills, they occasionally require updates that can be disruptive to your work flow, you need to spend time and work to learn to use them, and they sometimes have a price tag. <up class="green">[7]</up><br>
            In regards to my website, I could perhaps have been more efficient in time management, but I certainly utilised various IT tools that made planning and working on my project less of a headache than it would otherwise have been. furthermore, I believe that while the overall efficiency would have been improved by working in teams, the final product would have likely been quite different in both style and content, and personally I think that my website benefits from being a one-man project.</p><br><br>
        </div>

        <h3><b>1.3.2</b> Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency.</h3>

        <div class="text">
            <p>Personally, I think there are many ways to improve productivity and efficiency. One way is work environment, since doing this project from home means that, while certainly more comfortably, I probably wasn't as focused or distracted as I would otherwise have been if I had been working in a more dedicated work environment, such as an office or a library.
            Other ways include more rigorous time management, create a more linear and established plan (no multitasking), and giving yourself some nice motivational posters to look at while working.</p><br><br>
        </div>

        <h3><b>1.3.3</b> Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?</h3>

        <div class="text">
            <p>To improve productivity for any future project, I would possibly make greater use of Slack and other similar software to communicate better with others. I spent far to much time worrying over the style of the website, often comparing different styles, fonts, colours, sizes etc. It would have been better if I had asked others for their opinions on some the styles I was using, so I could better understand what works and what doesn't. Outside of that, working in a team could likely help build the basic website, but - similarly to my reasoning in 1.3.1 - the overall presentation of the website benefited from being a one-man project, and introducing others and their visions for how the website would be would complicate things.</p><br><br>
        </div>

        <h3><b>1.3.4</b> Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h3>

        <div class="text">
            <p>Once a problem has been detected, and the necessary changes have been made to correct it, the first and most fundamental step is to go back to the website - or whatever software/terminal you're working in - and reload it to check if the problem has been solved, or if it still persists. When testing a digital solution, it is often useful to test if a solution works in different browsers (e.g. Chrome or Safari), on different operating systems (e.g. Windows or Mac), or on different devices (e.g. desktop, laptop or mobile). Alternatively, if a problem was to do with images/margins/background/etc. alignment on the page, when a solution has been found it could be useful change the size of the page to see if it still works.</p><br><br><br><br>
